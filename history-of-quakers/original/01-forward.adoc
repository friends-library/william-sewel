William Sewel`'s _History of the Rise, Increase,
and Progress of the Christian People Called Quakers_ was first published in Dutch in 1717,
and then translated into English (by Sewel himself) and printed in 1722.
The original publication consisted of twelve volumes,
but was reprinted (with slightly modernized spelling
and punctuation) in 1832 in two large volumes.
The 1832 edition is in public domain,
and PDF scans of the two volumes are available online.
This particular version was obtained by copying the text from the PDFs,
pasting it into a Word document,
and then formatting the text and fixing the thousands
of errors that result from this process.
Most errors were found and fixed (by comparing them to the text of a printed copy),
but there are doubtless some that have been missed.

This document is the unabridged, two volume 1832 edition.
I have not modernized or modified the text in any way,
with the exception of adding one explanatory footnote,
and a few English translations for Latin phrases found throughout.
Before beginning, I suggest a quick perusal of the terms defined below.
